# rprint

### Just a little shitty project i did in my free time
Works on all platforms that support ANSI escape sequences.
Should work with Python `2.x` and `3.x`

Usage:
```python
from rprint import rprint

rprint("Hello, World")
```
```bash
python rprint Hello, World
```
Those methods would only work if you had the `rprint` folder in the same folder as you were currently in
